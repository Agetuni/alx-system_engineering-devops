# load balancer

Letâ€™s improve our web stack so that there is [redundancy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redundancy_%28engineering%29) for our web servers. This will allow us to be able to accept more traffic by doubling the number of web servers, and to make our infrastructure more reliable. If one web server fails, we will still have a second one to handle requests.

For this project, you will need to write Bash scripts to automate your work. All scripts must be designed to configure a brand new Ubuntu server to match the task requirements.

## Tasks :page_with_curl:

* **0. Double the number of webservers**
  * [0-custom_http_response_header](./0-custom_http_response-header): Bash
  script that installs and configures Nginx on a server with a custom HTTP
  response header.
    * The name of the HTTP header is `X-Served-By`.
    * The value of the HTTP header is the hostname of the server.

* **1. Install your load balancer**
  * [1-install_load_balancer](./1-install_load_balancer): Bash script that
  installs and configures HAproxy version 1.5 on a server.
    * Enables management via the init script.
    * Requests are distributed using a round-robin algorithm.
